If you do not want to Expose the creation logic of your application you can you factory and Abstract factory.
we create can object with out Exposing creation logic to the client and Refer to newly created objct using common interface
so can say that

A “Factory” class has a (usually static) function returning a pointer to a base class .
The actual object type depend on the arguments and/or other informations the function can obtain. 
The client does not depend on the derived classes. 
The client need not knowing all the informations needed to create the objects.
